# Open-Source-GWAS-Correlation-Platform
Developing a platform that detects gene variants that are correlative with increases in leukemic stem cells (mainly based on genome-wide association studies or GWAS).
- Primary Languages: HTML, CSS, Python, R, Flask, Java 

I built this with the aim of increasing remission rates for leukemia patients undergoing chemotherapy. I plan on building a front-end service that is accessible to all researchers and am working with computational biologists to expand this platform in the future.
