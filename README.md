# Open-Source-GWAS-Correlation-Platform
Building a platform that detects specific SNPs correlative with an increase in cancerous leukemic stem cells (based on GWAS)
- Primary Languages: Flask, HTML, CSS, Python, R, Java

I built this platform with the aim of increasing remission rates for leukemia patients who go through chemotherapy. I plan on building a front-end service that is accessible to all researchers and am working with computational biologists to expand this platform.
