# Open-Source-GWAS-Correlation-Platform
Developing a platform that detects specific genetic variants that are correlative with an increase in leukemic stem cells (based on genome-wide association studies).
- Primary Languages: HTML, CSS, Python, R, Java, Flask

I built this with the aim of increasing remission rates for leukemia patients who undergo chemotherapy. I plan on building a front-end service that is accessible to all researchers and am working with computational biologists to expand this platform in the future.
